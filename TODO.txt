Program flow needs to be fixed

Console navigation:
    - arrow keys to look at different runs (scrolling sorta)
    - quit button
    - sub menus

Recording runs to file
    - simple lines? csv? json?
    - consider async reading of poe log file and queueing up runs to add
    - save client.txt location

Graphs! (this might take some time, need to decide on a library)
    - total runs vs time scale
    - run average time vs time scale
    - percentage time running vs idle/selling (run efficiency?)
    - average runs per hour?
